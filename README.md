### Description and How To Use
This is a simple app to search movie titles and gather basic information such as release date, genre, and cast members, as well as other movies they've been in and a link to their profile. There is also support to search YouTube for the same movie title and displays the top result, allowing the user to see popular videos, clips, or trailers related to the movie of interest.

To use, simply type a movie title or search term in the field on the top of the screen. Movies with similar titles will be displayed on the left (desktop) or bottom (mobile), allowing one to select similarly titled movies if they desired. Clicking these titles will display content for that movie. 

The user may also view the top cast members for a movie, as well as one random movie they also appear in. Clicking on that movie's title will display details for that movie, but 
will keep the original search results visible so that the user can easily navigate back to the movie they started or see movies similar to their search.
